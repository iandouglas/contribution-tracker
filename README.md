# GitHub Contribution Tracker

Goal: scan an organization's repos to build some basic stats about who has contributed, giving weight to recency of contribution and net overall contributions.

Secondary goal: enter a single repo to gain similar stats

Tertiary goal: if the repo was a fork, only draw stats from the date the repo was forked, if that information is possible.
